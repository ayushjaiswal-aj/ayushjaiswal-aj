👋 Hi there! I'm a Software Engineer with experience in ASP.NET Core, Java, C/C++ and Flutter programming.

👨‍💻 I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from web applications to mobile apps and embedded systems, and I'm always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.

🌟 Some of my key skills include:

- Developing robust and scalable software solutions
- Implementing RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core and Java
- Designing and optimizing algorithms for performance and memory usage
- Writing clean and maintainable code using best practices and design patterns
- Creating cross-platform mobile apps using Flutter framework
- Debugging complex issues and finding elegant solutions

📚 In my free time, I enjoy reading about new technologies and experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks. I'm also a firm believer in open-source software and enjoy contributing to and collaborating on community projects.
